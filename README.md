This repository contains an extended implementation of a multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It is based on Chapter 11 of *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* by Raschka et al. (2022).

The primary goal of this project was to:
1. Modify the original code from Chapter 11 by adding a second hidden layer.
2. Implement and evaluate the performance of this architecture on the MNIST dataset using a train (70%)/test (30%) validation procedure.
3. Compare the predictive performance (macro AUC) of the modified ANN with:
   - The original single hidden layer ANN.
   - A fully connected ANN implemented using PyTorch.
